# Business Site

Individual project, creating a Business Site including a hero image/video form and an accordion. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I planned to have a video as hero-"image" so I started to find a suitable video for the format. The form went quite fast to create including text fields, password field, a set of radio buttons, a set of checkbox buttons and a submit button. The form is styled a little and the button has some animation. 

For me I tried put most time learning about JavaScript and how to use it for the FAQ where it is an accordion with questions and answers. It was the first time I used JavaScript so it was very tough to understand how everything are connected. It was easier to understand the design in CSS of the elements in the accordion. 

When I had time I added some hovering effects and box- and text-shadows. 

In next project I hope I get more learnings within JavaScript and that I can have to time to put even more time to it.
